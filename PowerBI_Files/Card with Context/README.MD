# 📈 KPI Card With Context

**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Version:** 1.0.0  

---

## 📝 Description

A simple yet effective **KPI card design** that adds **context** to performance metrics.  
Built with **standard Power BI visuals**, this example shows how to move beyond a single value and help users interpret what’s really happening behind the number.

It combines:  
- A KPI value compared to a prior period (month, quarter, or year)  
- A small **trend line** to show direction over time  
- **Narrative text** that explains the result in plain language  

This approach helps prevent misinterpretation and supports better decisions.
